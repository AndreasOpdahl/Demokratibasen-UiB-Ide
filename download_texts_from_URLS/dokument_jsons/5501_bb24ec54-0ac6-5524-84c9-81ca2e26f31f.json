It provides an overview of the reporting and implementation of key performance indicators (KPIs) for smart sustainable cities (SSC) in the City of Troms\u00f8, Norway. The U4SSC KPIs are based on Recommendation ITU-T Y.4903. This set of KPIs for SSC was developed to establish the criteria to evaluate ICTs\u2019 contributions in making cities smarter and more sustainable, and to provide cities with the means for self-assessments.

Introduction and Verification Background This report contains the verification results for the KPI submission by Troms\u00f8 to the requirements of the United for Smart Sustainable Cities (U4SSC) Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) as described within the \u2018Collection Methodology for Key Performance Indicators for Smart Sustainable Cities\u2019. John Smiciklas, who is certified as a U4SSC Key Performance Indicators for Smart Sustainable Cities Verifier, completed the verification in January 2022. The verification assessment activities included: \u2022 collecting and reviewing KPI data; \u2022 interviewing city stakeholders; \u2022 verifying that the data submitted are in conformance with the requirements of the Collection Methodology for Key Performance Indicators for Smart Sustainable Cities; and \u2022 preparing the Verification Report. The verification was conducted using the information made available by the city and the information presented during follow-up activities. It was planned and performed in order to obtain limited assurance with respect to the information examined. There were no limitations that impacted the completion of this verification. 2.

City Performance Benchmark Note: Performance Benchmark Targets apply to all sections of the graphic. Starting from the centre: Dimensions, Categories and KPIs. 5. Benchmarks and Scoring Methodology As part of the U4SSC KPIs project, benchmarks were developed for most KPIs in order to develop a reporting framework with which to demonstrate to cities how their performance could be reported. The benchmarks were set based on several factors: \u2022 fully meeting the aligned SDG(s); \u2022 performance compared with other international and transnational targets (e.g. OECD, European Commission); \u2022 performance against a UN agency\u2019s goals (e.g. International Telecommunication Union); \u2022 evaluation of city performance using UN and other international statistical data; and \u2022 performance measured versus leading city performance globally. Performance to benchmarks were then scored in four ranges for every KPI and data point reported: \u2022 0 \u2013 33 % of target \u2013 1 pt; \u2022 33 \u2013 66 % of target \u2013 2 pts; \u2022 66 \u2013 95 % of target \u2013 3 pts; and \u2022 95+ % of target \u2013 4 pts. The scores for each reported KPI and data point were added to give a percentage score for categories, sub-dimensions and dimensions and were reported based on the above target scores. KPIs or data points that are not reported or have no benchmarks yet defined were excluded. Example: Education 4 KPIs \u2022 If all 4 are reported and the scores are 1 pt, 3 pts, 4 pts and 1 pt; Total score 9 pts out of 16 = 56.25 % reported as 33 \u2013 66 % of target. \u2022 If only 3 are reported and the scores are 3 pts, 4 pts and 2 pts; Total score 9 pts out of 12 = 75 % reported as 66 \u2013 95 % of target. Targets and scoring are meant to provide additional context to KPI data and should be used in context with city goals and comparisons with other similar cities to determine future actions. 6.

Next Steps Troms\u00f8 is encouraged to focus on KPIs that have been reported as falling within the benchmarks of 0 \u2013 33 % and 33 \u2013 66 % of targets, determine which of these KPIs indicates critical issues for the city and develop plans for improvement. Troms\u00f8 is encouraged to review the KPIs for which no data were reported and determine plans for future data collection and reporting. Troms\u00f8 is encouraged to continue ongoing data collection to determine trends in performance against benchmarks over time. Troms\u00f8 is encouraged to stay engaged within the U4SSC process and continue to provide feedback on KPIs and benchmarks. 10. Using KPIs for SSC to Reach the SDGs The United for Smart Sustainable Cities (U4SSC) initiative has developed the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Smart Sustainable Cities (SSC) to support cities worldwide in evaluating the role and contribution of ICTs in smart sustainable cities, and to provide cities with the tools for self-assessments in order to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). United for Smart Sustainable Cities (U4SSC) U4SSC is a UN initiative coordinated by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), UN-Habitat and UNECE, and supported by 14 other UN Agencies and Programmes, including CBD, ECLAC, FAO, UNESCO, UNDP, UNECA, UN-Women, UNEP, UNEP-FI, UNFCCC, UNIDO, UNU- EGOV, UNOP and WMO. U4SSC is the global platform to advocate for public policies to encourage the use of ICTs to facilitate and ease the transition to smart sustainable cities. Find out more... These indicators are developed based on an international standard \u2013 Recommendation ITU-T Y.4903/L.1603 \u2018Key performance indicators for smart sustainable cities to assess the achievement of sustainable development goals\u2019. These indicators have been developed to provide cities with a consistent and standardized method to collect the necessary data to measure performance and progress with regard to: \u2022 achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); \u2022 becoming a smarter city; and \u2022 becoming a more sustainable city. The U4SSC KPIs consist of 91 indicators. Each indicator forms part of a holistic view of a city\u2019s performance in three dimensions: Economy, Environment and Society and Culture. Each of these dimensions provides a separate view of progress, and when reported together they provide a holistic view of a smart sustainable city. By providing a common set of metrics to benchmark a city\u2019s performance, the indicators will also enable cities to compare their performance to other cities, allowing for the dissemination of best practices and setting the standards for progression in meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the city level. The list of all the U4SSC KPIs for SSC, along with its collection methodology, are contained in: \u2022 the Flipbook on the \u2018Collection Methodology for Key Performance Indicators for Smart Sustainable Cities\u2019. Over 100 cities worldwide are already implementing these KPIs. All cities are invited to participate in this project and employ these KPIs.
