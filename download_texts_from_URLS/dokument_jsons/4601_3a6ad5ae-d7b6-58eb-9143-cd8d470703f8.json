Balance: It's crucial to balance the visual elements of both brands in the design. Achieving this balance can be done by either giving each logo equal space or incorporating both brands' design assets in a harmonious way. Consistency: The co-branded design should remain consistent with both brands' visual identities. This includes using the same fonts, colours, and design elements already established for each brand. Clarity: The co-branded design should be clear and easy to understand, avoiding clutter or excess design elements that might confuse or distract viewers. Relevance: The co-branded design should be relevant to both brands and their target audience. It should convey a clear message that resonates with the intended market. Collaboration: As co-branding is a collaborative effort, it's crucial to involve both brands in the design process. This ensures that the final design accurately represents both brands' values and identities.
