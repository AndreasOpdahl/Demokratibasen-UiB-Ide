  "tekst": " 12/11/2024 Dear Members of the Utvalg for finans, kultur og n\u00e6ring On behalf of the Board of Trustees and the broader International School of Bergen (ISB) community, we respectfully request the opportunity to address you in person at your meeting on Wednesday, November 20, 2024, to present our opposition to the proposed budget cuts by Bergen Kommune. As ISB approaches its 50th anniversary in 2025, its role as a cornerstone institution for Bergen cannot be overstated. ISB provides a globally accredited, English-language education that has been pivotal in attracting international professionals and investment to the region. Without ISB, Bergen would struggle to maintain its status as a dynamic, globally connected city. Consider the impact of ISB on major infrastructure and development projects. For instance, the ongoing Sotra Link project, critical to the region, benefits from the expertise of Korean engineers whose children (13 in total) attend ISB. Similarly, the Bybanen expansion relied on international talent, including a project manager from France whose family chose Bergen because of our school. ISB also supports academic and healthcare institutions by welcoming families of professionals from the University of Bergen, Haukeland University Hospital, and other research hubs. ISB is not just another private school-it is the only internationally accredited institution in the Bergen region offering a globally transferable, English-taught curriculum for students aged 3-16. In addition to its international accreditation, ISB is approved by UDIR in its compliance with the requirements of LK20 the Norwegian National Curriculum. ISB teaches Norwegian at all levels of access and as such plays a key role in the integration of our families into Norwegian society. This unique offering is integral to attracting and retaining international talent essential to Bergen\u2019s economic and cultural vibrancy. The proposed budget cuts threaten this vital resource. A 10% reduction in staffing would compromise academic quality, endanger the school\u2019s psychosocial environment, and jeopardise its international accreditation. Accreditation standards mandate specific staffing levels, and without them, ISB may lose the credentials that make it a magnet for global families. Furthermore, reducing support staff would weaken our ability to meet the diverse needs of our students, undermining ISB\u2019s reputation and discouraging international families from choosing Bergen. Bergen Kommune\u2019s current funding arrangement, established through Bergens N\u00e6ringsr\u00e5d, acknowledges the essential role ISB plays in facilitating international professionals\u2019 relocation to Bergen. With nearly 250 students from almost 40 countries, ISB is not a typical private school. Were it to close, the Kommune would face significant challenges in accommodating this community on short notice. In addition to this letter, we include a copy of the slideshow presentation we will make in the face-to-face meeting. We have also included testimonials from staff, parents, alumni, and companies that rely on ISB. Their voices reflect the profound importance of ISB to Bergen\u2019s prosperity. We urge you to reconsider these cuts in the interest of the wider Bergen community. We look forward to elaborating on these points during the in-person session. Thank you for your attention to this critical matter. Yours sincerely, Peter Ledger Director On behalf of the Board of Trustees, International School of Bergen International School of Bergen | Sandslihaugen 36, 5254 Sandsli, Norway | +47 55 30 63 30 | www.isbergen.no "
