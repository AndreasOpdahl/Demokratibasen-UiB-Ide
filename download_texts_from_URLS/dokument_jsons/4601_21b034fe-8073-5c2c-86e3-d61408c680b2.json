Saksnummer Dato for vedtaket 08.04.2025 Dato mottatt vedtak 08.04.2025 \u00d8nsket endring - begrunnelse Hi I'm Juyoun Kim who is the owner of the Nedre Korskirkeallmenningen 12b on the 2nd floor. I request the building permit for Folk&r\u00f8vere which is the same building on the 1st floor to be immediately cancelled. In this building there are 4 owners. 1 st floor. \u2022 Stian Hofstad (the house master) who is representing Folk&r\u00f8vere, bought it last summer. He is not living here. 2nd floor. \u2022 Me. I'm the only owner who is living here and has also been doing a therapy business for over 18 years and I'm a single mom living 50% together with my 8-year-old boy. 3rd floor. Klaus Johannsen \u2022 My X-husband who is not living here. 4th floor. Thorleif Wedaa H\u00f8nsi \u2022 He is not living here. Explanation It started last September when the Folk&r\u00f8vere bought the 1st floor. Stian and my X husband and 4th floor, they didn't inform me of the House Master Election. Therefore I couldn't attend the meeting. Stian was selected as house master and the other two owners automatically became board members. Therefore Stian sent an email separately to them, who are the border members and me who is not the border member of the building BK057-FELLES-klage-vedtak, Bergen kommune Side 1 av 2 Klage p\u00e5 vedtak and they decided everything without me until now. I just got to know why they could decide everything without me yesterday. I complained a lot but no one explained to me and. Stian, who is the house master, never explains it to me. Just ignored me. Also Stian just informed me that they got a construction permission from Bergen Kommune. So they will start construction on14th April. There will be a lot of noise for many months. How can they get permission without me who is living and doing business on top of them. It has to be my situation and needs to be involved. So that is illegal. The Bergen kommune has to cancel the permission. If not, I will report it to the newspaper. This is an illegal construction and decision. And tomorrow we will have a house meeting and I will also be a board member in this Building. I hope to hear from you very soon Stian did not send any information about that they applied for construction in 1 st floor. He had a meeting with me and did not tell me anything about it.
