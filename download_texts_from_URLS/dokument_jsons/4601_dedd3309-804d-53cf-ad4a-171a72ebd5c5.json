It was a pleasure to organize the event and host you in Reykjav\u00edk. We hope you left inspired, with new ideas and valuable connections with other Nordic professionals. The Nordic countries should remain the best place for children and young people. The Storbyens hjerte og smerte conference focuses on improving their living conditions. Joining professionals from all Nordic countries every other year is crucial. We aim to ensure that children and young people feel good, know their rights, and participate in decisions affecting them. Young people played a significant role in organizing the Reykjav\u00edk Stronger Together conference. In March, a youth conference, U-LYNC, was held in Reykjav\u00edk, prepared by a large group of young people. We are grateful to everyone involved in both conferences. Special thanks to the young participants, keynote speakers, and workshop leaders. Thank you all for your excellent participation and presentations. We look forward to seeing you again!

These voices had been carefully considered and discussed at the U-LYNC youth conference held in Reykjav\u00edk in March. Intended for professionals, staff, officials, politicians, and researchers who deal with issues affecting young people in Nordic cities, the conference showcased the outcomes of the U-LYNC project\u2014Urban Life of Young People in the Nordic Countries: Challenges and Opportunities. The U-LYNC conference brought together around 80 young people from 10 cities to discuss pressing issues such as Youth Participation, Mental Health, Education, Sustainability, and Diversity. The insights and ideas generated by these young voices were presented to the leaders of the 10 Nordic cities, highlighting the importance of youth perspectives in shaping future policies and initiatives. The U-LYNC project not only provided a platform for these discussions but also emphasized the collective strength and potential of Nordic youth in addressing contemporary challenges.
