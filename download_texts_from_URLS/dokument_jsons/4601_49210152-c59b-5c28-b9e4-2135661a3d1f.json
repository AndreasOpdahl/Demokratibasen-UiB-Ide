Clinic UM pregnant women and children allowed full access necessary care was founded 2013 2017 9 And What\u2019s Been Happening in the Background \u27a22011 Global Clinic was founded \u25cb The need came from the growing amount of EU\u2019s moving population > only when a low-threshold clinic was opened, the need became visible \u25cb Advocacy work on local level \u25cb What was important: \u25a0 Openness (eg. cooperation with the police) \u25a0 Research approach: finding out what the health problems are like for the UM \u27a22013: Local decision (Helsinki) on undocumented pregnant women and children \u27a2After national law proposal failed in 2015 > targeting advocacy to local decision makers 10 \u27a2 2017 Helsinki local decision for all UM \u25cb Clearly a value issue to both political sides > protracted process, the decision was made at night after a long conversation \u25cb Decision making process divided political parties (right and left wing), votes: 45-39 \u25cb Local guidelines published 6/2018 > it took a long time before the guidelines were made (approx. one year) > advocacy work is needed also for the work after the decision making process! \u25cb Advocacy work in local level: \u25a0 Active relations with the local politicians, eg. delivering background information for important meetings \u25a0 Reminding health stations about the new rules \u25cb Reformists inside the system are important (politicians but also officials in the bureaus) \u27a2 Setting an example: Other municipalities followed Helsinki\u2019s decision one by one 11 \u27a2 2019 > parliament election and new government program: Access to necessary health care for all UM proposed \u25cb Global Clinic volunteers, PSR, the Finnish Medical Association and other NGO\u2019s and medical specialists provided information and research material for favourable political parties > tools to defend the proposal \u25a0 I.e. meeting with the Minister of Health \u25a0 The importance of allies \u25cb Helsinki\u2019s situation was closely followed and used as an example \u25a0 Low costs \u25a0 Local leaders were pleased \u27a2 November 2022: New law passed the governmental voting \u27a2 1.1.2023: New law came into effect 12 How to Get There \u27a2 Use the authority of health care professionals > in this case eg.
