Open Out Festival is an annual one-week art festival in Troms\u00f8 putting forward queer artists and performers and serving as a strong and important player to make the art scene in Troms\u00f8 more diverse, accessible and open! It is the only contemporary visual arts festival with an inherent focus on queer issues in Norway, and our cross disciplinary events stimulates and develops the professional art and cultural life in Troms\u00f8. The festival consists of a festival exhibition, a performance programme, concerts, community events, and debates. We prioritise artists from the LGBTQ+ community as well as other social minority groups. We are applying to the Troms\u00f8 Municipality for funding, as well as to other public and private funding, so that we can make this possible and to keep the festival events free; this is especially important so that more people can have access to art, and so that people from different communities and backgrounds can find a safer and free space where they can meet, exchange and express themselves. 701785, Sem & Stenersen Prokom Prokorn AS Side 1 av 4 Kultur- og idrettstilskudd - s\u00f8knad The Open Out organisation has its roots in autumn 2017, and has since taken place for 5 years in a row. The current festival team is composed of Marion Bouvier (FR/NO), Camilla Renate Nicolaisen (NO), Kristina Primakova (RU/IT) and Amalie Holten (NO) and Olga Gry Becker (DK/NO). Tiltak/prosjekt Ti Itak/prosjekt Form\u00e5l med det oms\u00f8kte tiltaket Our primary goal is to showcase high quality contemporary art within a queer perspective. The aim of the festival is three-fold: To strengthen and promote the presence of queer, feminist and intersectional perspectives on the art scene and more generally in society. The way we understand \"queerness\" \u201cqueerness\u201d is both in terms of sexual orientations (non-heteorsexual), gender diversities outside of the binary, as well as in a more political sense; it is about challenging dominant narratives and reinventing the future with a stronger focus on alternative visions within society. We want to give voice to LGBTQ+ artists, indigenous peoples, immigrants and refugees as well as other social minorities who do not alway get to be presented on the art scene and/ or in society. To make quality art events accessible to a wider audience - this includes minority groups, teenagers with a sparking interest in art and queer subjects. We do this by ensuring that all our events are free and by advertising through different channels. We also expand the arena in which art is being shown - with performances happening in public spaces, by changing location every year and showing art in spaces that are usually used for other things: old shops, Havneterminalen, etc. To stimulate artistic creation and queer community building in Northern Norway through a local and global approach; the festival brings in artists from all over Europe to show their work in Troms\u00f8, which contributes to instill new ideas and dynamism on the local art scene. And through also showcasing local artists and artist collective\u2019s collective's work, we serve as a platform for exchange of knowledge and ideas, new collaborations occur and communities build both locally and also across borders. Being a queer art festival based in Troms\u00f8 for 6 years, we feel a direct and strong connection to Troms\u00f8. As if Troms\u00f8 itself is queer; the oblique, one of many off-centered cities in Norway. Being situated-from situated \u2013from the South perspective\u2013 perspective- far away from the rest of the world. We experience the artscene in the North as a bit different from other art scenes. It is its own growing little ecosystem with helping hands of interdisciplinary local collaborations and chosen family and Open Out has a lot of potential to grow within this and to enrich emich the cultural life in Troms\u00f8. M\u00e5lgruppe Open Out is free and open to all, 0 - 100. Or rather; open to everyone that is open to others; queerness, normcritical views, gender non confirming identities and all the ones that do not fit into any categories or belong to several minority groups at the same time. Open Out is organised by queers, puts forward queer artists and is concerned about making an inclusive and safer space. Growing up and living in a society where white, heteronormative life and perspectives are often the ones being shown and reproduced within art, movies and in music, it is very important and crucial to experience something/ someone on stage or in an exhibition that share similar perspectives or life situations. We want to give this experience to people in Troms\u00f8 of all ages, but especially youth between 15-30. Sadly, there is no stable physical queer spaces in Troms\u00f8, so the need for queer initiatives is deeply felt throughout the whole year. People have expressed to us how important it is for them to have a place to meet other likely minded people. We are very aware of the fact that we are one of very few initiatives focusing on queer art and community building. It is very important to have spaces to meet and we know that the Open Out Festival is a pivotal and 701785, Sem & Stenersen Prokom Prokorn AS Side 2 av 4 Kultur- og idrettstilskudd - s\u00f8knad important event for the LGBTQ+ and art community in Troms\u00f8! Art has a strong power to spark conversations and the format of the festival has the power to serve as a ground for building networks, bridges and close friendships. Planlagte aktiviteter Open Out Festival 2023 - CURRENTS: September 23rd - September 30th. The festival will consist of a week-long program with a main exhibition and performances/events/guided tours every day of the festival. We will invite 15 - 18 artists to take part of the festival and we will set a programme with both visual art and performing art. All events are free and open to all. // 2023 - CURRENTS // For the coming year we have chosen the theme to be CURRENTS. This word holds many meanings. As an adjective for \u2018belonging 'belonging in the present time; being used or done now\u2019. now'. It is also a noun with two meanings; an ocean current, a body of water moving in a definite direction, an electric current, the flow of electricity in an electronic circuit. It is a theme that can be understood metaphorically but also very literally/ politically, leaving space for both artists and visitors to make their own connections and associations. For the 2023 edition of the festival we will thrive to put together a similar programme as in 2022 in terms of diversity of expression: 1l group exhibition showcasing video, sculpture, drawings and mixed media installations by 13 artists/ artist groups 2 concerts 4 community events such as dinners and karaoke nights 4 workshops 9 performances 1l outside performance in public space 2 parties with DJ's DJ\u2019s // OTHER EVENTS // Amongst the communal events that we did in the 2022 edition of Open Out was a karaoke night. We got overwhelming feedback from the audience on this event, saying that this was something they had really missed in Troms\u00f8 - a place to go out, have fun and feel safe. Therefore we are planning to do a similar \u2018one 'one night\u2019 night' event in the spring in collaboration with KURANT9000.
