Therefore, you will benefit from all EU rights applying to packages. Company XY, as the organiser of this package, [where appropriate under the applicable national law] [and company XZ, as a retailer,]1 is [are] fully responsible for the proper performance of the package. Additionally, as required by law, your payments to company XY [(where appropriate) and company YZ)2] are protected and, where the return journey is included in the package, your repatriation is guaranteed if this company/these companies were to become insolvent. More information on key rights under Directive (EU) 2015/2302, including on payments, contract changes, cancellations, refunds, liability for improper performance and insolvency protection as well as parties to be contacted can be obtained here (to be provided in the form of a hyperlink). Following the hyperlink, the traveller will receive the following information: Key rights under Directive (EU) 2015/2302 Information \u2014 Travellers will receive all essential information about the package before concluding the package travel contract. \u2014 This includes information on the price and on the payments due at the time of booking. Travellers may, in principle, not be asked to pay more than 25% of the total price at the time of booking (downpayments) and the remaining payments may not be requested earlier than 28 days before departure. However, organisers may ask for downpayments higher than 25% where this is necessary to ensure the organisation and performance of the package. \u2014 After concluding a package travel contract travellers will receive the contract on a durable medium (for example, on paper or per e-mail). 1 The correct alternative is to be chosen by the Member States in light of their transposition of the Directive. 2 See footnote 1. EN 1 EN Liable trader and contact points \u2014 There is always at least one trader who is liable for the proper performance of all travel services included in a package. This trader is the organiser of the package as identified by the text in the box above and in the contract. The contract must contain the organiser\u2019s contact details. \u2014 Where a package is sold via a retailer, travellers can always also contact the retailer if there are any problems or to pass messages to the organiser. The retailer\u2019s contact details are also provided in the contract. Depending on the applicable national law, retailers may also be liable for the performance of the package. \u2014 Travellers will be given an emergency telephone number or details of a contact point where they can get in touch with the organiser or the retailer (travel agent) while they are on their trip or holiday. Transfer of the contract \u2014 Travellers may transfer the package to another person, possibly subject to a fee. The traveller must give reasonable notice to the organiser or, where applicable, to the retailer. Price increases \u2014 The price of the package may only be increased if specific costs rise (for instance, fuel prices) and if expressly provided for in the contract, and at the latest 20 days before the start of the package. If the price increase exceeds 8% of the price of the package, travellers may terminate the contract and will, in that case, get their money back. If, in the contract, the organiser reserves the right to a price increase, travellers have a right to a price reduction if there is a decrease in the relevant costs. Termination of the contract before the start of a package \u2014 Travellers may terminate the contract without paying any termination fee and get a full refund of any payments if any of the essential elements of the package are changed significantly or if there is a price increase exceeding 8% of the price of the package. \u2014 If, before the start of the package, the trader responsible for the package cancels the package, travellers are entitled to a refund and compensation where appropriate. \u2014 Travellers may terminate the contract without paying any termination fee before the start of the package if unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances significantly affect the trip or holiday. Examples of extraordinary circumstances include natural disasters, serious security problems or public health risks which can reasonably be expected to affect the package. \u2014 Additionally, travellers may, at any time before the start of the package, terminate the contract, including on personal grounds, in return for an appropriate and justifiable termination fee. Travellers must be informed on applicable termination fees before concluding the contract and in the contract. Refunds EN 2 EN \u2014 In all cases where the organiser or the traveller cancels the package, travellers must receive a refund of their payments within 14 days (where appropriate, taking termination fees into account). The organiser of the package is responsible for the refund. Where a retailer is involved and where this is required by the applicable national law, also the retailer is responsible for refunds. \u2014 Where the organiser offers a voucher to be used for a future trip instead of a refund within 14 days, travellers will receive information on their rights in relation to the voucher and may choose to accept it or not. Problems during the trip or holiday \u2014 The organiser is obliged to remedy problems occurring during the performance of the package. Travellers must inform the organiser of problems they encounter. \u2014 If significant elements of the package cannot be provided as agreed, the organiser must offer suitable alternative arrangements at no extra cost. Travellers may terminate the contract without paying any fee, where services are not performed in accordance with the contract, where this substantially affects the performance of the package, and the organiser fails to remedy the problem. \u2014 Travellers are also entitled to a price reduction and/or compensation for damages where the travel services are not performed or are improperly performed under the conditions set out in Directive (EU) 2015/2302. \u2014 The organiser has to provide assistance if the traveller is in difficulty, for instance through providing information on health services, local authorities and consular assistance and offering the possibility to make distance communications. Insolvency protection \u2014 If the organiser becomes insolvent, travellers\u2019 payments will be refunded. In some Member States there is also insolvency protection for payments to retailers. If the organiser or, where applicable, the retailer becomes insolvent after the start of the package and if the return journey is included in the package, repatriation of travellers is secured. XY has taken out insolvency protection with YZ (the entity in charge of the insolvency protection, for example a guarantee fund or an insurance company). Travellers may contact this entity or, where applicable, the competent authority (contact details, including name, geographical address, email and telephone number) if services are denied because of XY's insolvency.
