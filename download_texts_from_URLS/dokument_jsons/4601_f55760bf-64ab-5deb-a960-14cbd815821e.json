  "tekst": "Til utvalget for finans, kultur og n\u00e6ring, og Utvalg for barnehage, skole og idrett, Jeg skriver som beboer i Bergen og forelder ved International School of Bergen (ISB) for \u00e5 uttrykke min sterke bekymring over de foresl\u00e5tte kuttene som rammer skolens \u00f8konomiske situasjon. Disse kuttene vil f\u00e5 alvorlige konsekvenser for b\u00e5de elever og det lokale samfunnet. Vi valgte ISB for s\u00f8nnen v\u00e5r p\u00e5 grunn av skolens unike internasjonale l\u00e6ringsperspektiv, som gir elevene en bredere forst\u00e5else av verden og forbereder dem p\u00e5 globale utfordringer. En betydelig \u00f8kning i skolepengene vil tvinge mange familier til \u00e5 vurdere andre alternativer, noe som kan f\u00f8re til at elever mister et etablert nettverk og et trygt l\u00e6ringsmilj\u00f8. For elever som ikke har norsk som morsm\u00e5l, kan en slik overgang v\u00e6re spesielt utfordrende. I v\u00e5rt tilfelle kan vi telle nesten like mange nasjoner representert som det er barn i 2. trinn p\u00e5 ISB, og elevenes foreldre er ofte h\u00f8yt utdannede og bidrar til forsknings-, kultur- og n\u00e6ringslivet i Bergen. Skolen bidrar til \u00e5 tiltrekke internasjonale familier til Bergen og styrker byens posisjon som et attraktivt sted \u00e5 bo og drive n\u00e6ringsvirksomhet. Jeg ber dere derfor p\u00e5 det sterkeste om \u00e5 revurdere de foresl\u00e5tte kuttene. ISB er en verdifull ressurs for Bergen, og \u00e5 opprettholde et mangfoldig og inkluderende utdanningstilbud er en investering i fremtiden. Med vennlig hilsen, Martin Philip Shultz Tlf. 45124954 mshultz@gmail.com Bergen, 8th November 2024 Dear Utvalg for finans, kultur og n\u00e6ring, & Utvalg for barnehage, skole og idrett I am now a Bergen resident and for the past 20 years, I have worked with startups and small business in Europe and the Americas. In times when Norway is looking for avenues to diversify its economy beyond oil and traditional industries, studies and anecdotal evidence show me that local startups in Bergen have a tendency to focus their scope of business on the domestic market, while startups from cities like Oslo and Trondheim, with larger tech scenes and more diversified industries, often foster a more global outlook and are more inclined to internationalise early. Children of all ages at the International School of Bergen (ISB) have a truly global mindset that I have not found in the startup ecosystem in Bergen. I believe that ISB plays a pivotal role in fostering a global mindset in Bergen and supporting a shift toward a more diversified economy in several ways: \u2022 ISB\u2019s holistic and internationally focused curriculum emphasises critical thinking, problem- solving, and collaboration\u2014skills that are essential for navigating global markets and diverse industries. \u2022 By instilling a global perspective, ISB encourages students to think beyond traditional career paths and consider entrepreneurship, innovation, and sustainability as viable futures. \u2022 ISB attracts families from multinational companies, international research institutions, and foreign entrepreneurial ventures. This diverse community offers networking opportunities for local families and students to engage with global perspectives early on. For Bergen\u2019s younger generation, attending ISB means forming connections with peers from various cultural and professional backgrounds, which can broaden horizons and foster an interest in working internationally or attracting international talent and business to Bergen. \u2022 For international researchers, Ph.D. candidates, and other foreign professionals considering relocation, the presence of an established international school like ISB is often a decisive factor. ISB is helping Bergen attract highly skilled international talent by offering education that aligns with global standards and supports diverse learning needs. This indirectly strengthens Bergen\u2019s reputation as an international business-friendly city and helps in retaining foreign talent who might otherwise seek opportunities in cities with more diverse educational options. Together, these factors position ISB as a catalyst in shifting Bergen\u2019s business culture toward an outward- looking and diversified economy. By nurturing a new generation of globally minded students, ISB supports Bergen\u2019s transformation into a more dynamic, international city capable of attracting and retaining global talent and promoting business innovation. As a father of 2 ISB children, I am writing to express my concern about the proposed funding cuts and their impact on the school's survival. In light of the significance the school has in making Bergen an attractive destination for both the business and academic communities alike, and for the local and international families who depend on ISB, I implore you to reconsider these cuts. Kind regards, Ignacio Pereyra 11/5/24, 1:35 PM International School of Bergen Mail - Concerns Regarding Proposed Funding Cuts to ISB Peter Ledger <peter.ledger@isbergen.no> Concerns Regarding Proposed Funding Cuts to ISB 1 message Miriam Danielsen <miriam0553@hotmail.com> 5 November 2024 at 12:14 To: \"peter.ledger@isbergen.no\" <peter.ledger@isbergen.no>, Tore Andreas Danielsen <tore.danielsen@oppsteg.no> Dear Utvalg for finans, kultur og n\u00e6ring and Utvalg for barnehage, skole og idrett, I am writing to express my concern regarding the proposed funding cuts to the International School of Bergen (ISB), a matter that directly affects our family and many others who have chosen ISB for its unique educational offerings. As a Bergen resident and parent of two children at ISB, I feel compelled to share our personal experience with the school and why maintaining the current funding model is so important, not just for us, but for many families in the community who rely on ISB for an inclusive and supportive education. After several years of struggle with exclusion and bullying at our local school, we made the difficult decision to withdraw our youngest son. Despite multiple meetings with the school and action plans that were never followed through, our son\u2019s well-being and educational needs were not being met. A child has only one childhood, and we could no longer watch him suffer in an environment where he didn\u2019t feel safe or supported. We chose ISB because we wanted a school that would foster his intellectual and social development in an environment where diversity was celebrated and individuality was respected. Our son, who had lost trust in adults after years of broken promises, found a place at ISB where he was seen and valued for who he is. The school\u2019s approach\u2014focused on relationship-building, emotional support, and a strong sense of community\u2014was exactly what he needed. We saw a dramatic change in him: he became more confident, more engaged, and for the first time in years, he felt that he truly belonged. This positive experience is why, when it came time for our middle son to move to secondary school, there was no question in our minds that he would attend ISB as well. Our previous experiences at the local secondary school for our eldest daughter, had been a stark contrast. The school environment was marked by frequent incidents of violence, vandalism, bullying, and general chaos, including disturbing reports through the VIGOLO app about fights, drug problems, and unsafe behavior. While we were fortunate that our eldest daughter was able to stand firm in her values, we know that not all students are as resilient, and many seek belonging in unhealthy or dangerous environments. Our experience with ISB has been a refreshing change. The secondary school has been a place where respect for both teachers and students is paramount, where students are encouraged to grow and explore in a safe and supportive environment. The school has fostered a culture of https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ik=4821c0adb8&view=pt&search=all&permthid=thread-f:1814880896285710810%7Cmsg-f:1814880896285710810&simpl=msg-f:1814880896285710810&mb=1 1/2 11/5/24, 1:35 PM International School of Bergen Mail - Concerns Regarding Proposed Funding Cuts to ISB positive relationships, mutual respect, and intellectual curiosity. These are the qualities that make ISB a unique institution, not only for our children but for the entire community. The proposed funding cuts to ISB would significantly affect families like ours, who depend on the school\u2019s unique educational model. These cuts could lead to increased fees, which would place an undue financial burden on us and others who have already made the commitment to international education. More concerning, however, is the potential impact on the school\u2019s ability to maintain the high-quality, inclusive environment that our children\u2014and many others\u2014depend on. ISB\u2019s emphasis on personal development, diversity, and a safe learning space has had a profound and lasting impact on our children, and it is crucial that this continues to be available to future students. ISB contributes to Bergen\u2019s rich diversity and international character, and its impact extends beyond the families directly enrolled. The school plays an essential role in fostering global awareness and cultural understanding, which ultimately benefits the entire community. ISB\u2019s inclusive approach has not only provided our children with a high-quality education but also helped to shape them into open-minded, compassionate individuals who will contribute positively to society. In light of these considerations, I urge you to carefully reconsider the proposed funding cuts. The impact on local and international families who rely on ISB for their children's education would be profound. We are incredibly grateful for the opportunities the school has provided our children, and we believe it is essential for the community to continue to support ISB in its mission to provide an inclusive, high-quality education. Thank you for your time and consideration.

I am an international researcher who has worked in Trondheim and Bergen in Norway. Due to the international nature of my Job, the international curriculum and multicultural environment, our family has chosen international schools as education places for our kids. In Trondheim, our three kids went to international schools which were very well funded by the municipality. Indeed Trondheim has two international schools and the school fees are very low. When I got my current job in Bergen, the school fees that we spent for three kids in Trondheim were not enough for one kid at ISB because the contribution from Bergen municipality is very low compared to the contribution of Trondheim municipality. We therefore sent only one of our kids to ISB. The proposed cuts would significantly impact families like ours who have committed to international education in Bergen. Beyond the immediate financial burden of increased fees, these changes will strongly affect us. ISB contributes to Bergen's diversity and international character, which benefits all residents. I urge you to reconsider these cuts and their impact on both local and international families who depend on ISB.

Having lived in Bergen for many years, we have seen how ISB has contributed to our city's growth. Our family has been part of the ISB community for over four years. We have chosen ISB because of the international curriculum, multicultural environment, support and care for the children. The proposed cuts would significantly impact families like ours who have committed to international education in Bergen. We work in international environments ourselves, related to research, education and shipping. We can clearly see that the participation of children of the local residents enrich the school and positively contribute to diversity. They will take the international experience with them to shape the development of Bergen in the decades to come. We fear that the proposed cuts might create too significant economic barrier for many local families to be able to continue the education at ISB. We would kindly ask you to reconsider these cuts and their impact on both local and international families who depend on ISB. https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/?ik=9ad17f1290&view=pt&search=all&permthid=thread-f:1815368968889147746&simpl=msg-f:1815368968889147746 1/2 11/12/24, 12:28 PM International School of Bergen Mail - ISB budget cut feedback Kind regards, Lidia Puka-Kj\u00f8de https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/?ik=9ad17f1290&view=pt&search=all&permthid=thread-f:1815368968889147746&simpl=msg-f:1815368968889147746 2/2 11/12/24, 12:29 PM International School of Bergen Mail - ISB Budget cut feedback Parent Support <parentsupport@isbergen.no> ISB Budget cut feedback 1 message Kari Aastveit <kaastveit@hotmail.com> 10 November 2024 at 20:24 To: \"parentsupport@isbergen.no\" <parentsupport@isbergen.no> Til: Utvalg for finans, kultur og n\u00e6ring, & Utvalg for barnehage, skole og idrett Jeg skriver for \u00e5 uttrykke min bekymring vedr\u00f8rende de foresl\u00e5tte kutt i budsjettet til Den Internasjonale skolen i Bergen (ISB). Jeg mener det gj\u00f8res en stor urett ved \u00e5 kutte i tilbudet til elevene ved skolen. ISB har en viktig posisjon for \u00e5 ivareta mangfoldet i Bergen, og det er ogs\u00e5 et viktig supplement til den offentlige skolen. Mange elever som ikke finner seg til rette i den kommunale skolen kan fungere fint p\u00e5 ISB. Istedenfor \u00e5 kutte i budsjettet burde Bergen Kommune heller se hvordan ISB klarer \u00e5 f\u00e5 elever med varierte bakgrunner og forutsetninger til \u00e5 l\u00e6re og trives i fellesskapet. Jeg er mor til to jenter i Upper School (6.-10. trinn). Begge gikk p\u00e5 sin kommunale n\u00e6rskole, og vi hadde ikke andre planer for jentene v\u00e5re enn vanlig, offentlig skole. Begge er f\u00f8dt tidlig p\u00e5 \u00e5ret, de er flittige og l\u00e6rer fort. S\u00e5 hva kunne g\u00e5 galt? Ganske mye, viste det seg. P\u00e5 skolen var alt tilsynelatende bra, de laget aldri br\u00e5k og gjorde alt de skulle. Men hjemme var det en annen historie. Det er fryktelig dyrt \u00e5 ha to barn p\u00e5 ISB, men \u00f8konomisk kommer vi likevel bedre ut. N\u00e5r barna ikke vil p\u00e5 skolen kan ikke begge foreldre st\u00e5 i jobb, regnestykket er s\u00e5nn sett enkelt. Men det blir vanskeligere for oss om utgiftene skal \u00f8ke enda mer. Som logoped og spesialpedagog kjenner jeg den kommunale skolen godt ogs\u00e5 fra innsiden. Jeg har jobbet ved til sammen fire barneskoler og to ungdomsskoler i Bergen kommune. Da barna v\u00e5re ikke trivdes p\u00e5 n\u00e6rskolen hadde jeg nok innsikt til \u00e5 forst\u00e5 at et lokalt skolebytte ikke ville l\u00f8se problemet. Mer av det samme p\u00e5 nytt sted l\u00f8ser ingenting. https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/?ik=9ad17f1290&view=pt&search=all&permthid=thread-f:1815364688532869819&simpl=msg-f:1815364688532869819 1/2 11/12/24, 12:29 PM International School of Bergen Mail - ISB Budget cut feedback P\u00e5 ISB har alle elever en forutsigbarhet, som det ikke finnes noen parallel til i den offentlige skolen. Det n\u00e6rmeste vi kommer her er oppf\u00f8lging av elever med s\u00e6rskilte behov, som har sin egen, oversiktlige timeplan limt fast p\u00e5 pulten sin. Da har eleven slitt en god stund, og PPT har som regel v\u00e6rt inne i bildet. P\u00e5 ISB har b\u00e5de elever og foreldre mulighet til full oversikt over hva som skjer til enhver tid, hva som skal gj\u00f8res, og spesifikke tilbakemeldinger p\u00e5 arbeid som er utf\u00f8rt. Ved sykdom kan eleven \u00e5pne timeplanen hjemmefra, der st\u00e5r n\u00f8yaktig instruksjoner p\u00e5 hva som skal gj\u00f8res og eleven kan klikke seg inn p\u00e5 relevante videoer eller nettsider. P\u00e5 ISB ble jentene mine tatt imot p\u00e5 en slik m\u00e5te at de f\u00f8lte seg velkommen fra dag \u00e9n. ISB har et system for \u00e5 ta i mot nye elever, uansett n\u00e5r de kommer og hvor de kommer fra. Elevene er vant til \u00e5 ta seg av nye som kommer. Variasjonen i elevmassen er stor, og takh\u00f8yden og toleransen enda st\u00f8rre. Bergen trenger ISB, byen blir fattigere uten dette skoletilbudet.

As academics at the University of Bergen and Haukeland University Hospital, we can add that an international school is essential for attracting top researchers globally. This is significant for Bergen as an international city and as an educational and research center. In addition same applicable to IT, Oil & gas industry. ISB provide us good community development for expats moved either short or long term. For many families before moving to a city/country first consideration is to have a good school which have good class size, facilities , infrastructure and teachers. I also moved to Bergen when we found that Bergen have an good international school where my child can study IB curriculum along with Norwegian language by paying affordable school fee as its supported by Kommune. Due to these cuts each family will have financial impact as it will result to more increase in school fee. Which will have high possibility that many kids have to forcefully leave school as family might not able to afford more higher fee than current fees. This will have very bad impact for school in long run. Other cities like Oslo, Stavanger already have Internation schools with good support from kommune hence We urge you to reconsider these cuts as it will have high impact on both local and international families who depend on ISB. https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/?ik=9ad17f1290&view=pt&search=all&permthid=thread-f:1815362251285629913&simpl=msg-f:1815362251285629913 1/2 11/12/24, 12:30 PM International School of Bergen Mail - ISB budget cut feedback Kind regards, Rohitashva Dangi Ph - 92553726 https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/?ik=9ad17f1290&view=pt&search=all&permthid=thread-f:1815362251285629913&simpl=msg-f:1815362251285629913 2/2 11/12/24, 12:31 PM International School of Bergen Mail - ISB budget cut feedback Parent Support <parentsupport@isbergen.no> ISB budget cut feedback 1 message Brekalo Bruno <brun@odfjelloceanwind.com> 10 November 2024 at 19:42 To: \"parentsupport@isbergen.no\" <parentsupport@isbergen.no> Dear, After hearing about plan for the budget cuts to the International School of Bergen, we are deeply concerned about the future of our children education and ISB school future. Our 2 children are a part of ISB community since we have moved to Bergen in 2022, and we are very pleased with high level of education as well as with very positive environment within the school. Acceptance of our children to ISB was a pre-requisite for our move to Norway, as they have been a part of IB program for their whole school life previously in South Korea and Croatia. We were very pleased to learn about history of the school upon arrival, its move to new premises that has increased capabilities and education quality, and as such were ensured for our children future. Our concern now is not only increase of school fees that could impact our life here, but also quality of education standards. Bergen is a multicultural city with strong industry which draws number of international families, hence international school shall keep its education standards and capacity in years to come. Please reconsider your decisions and continue with support to our school, having in mind the future of Bergen as international and welcoming community that we all are proud of.

Having lived in Bergen for 20 years, I have seen how ISB has contributed to our city's growth as an international hub. Our family has been part of the ISB community for all these years. We moved to Bergen from Poland. Our daughter has graduated from ISB and continued her education in United World College, where she represented Bergen among students from all over the world. Our son is in his 7th grade, and would like to graduate from ISB as well. We feel that ISB offers a very high quality of education and promotes international understanding. If it was not for the IB program at ISB, we would not have decided to live permanently in Bergen. The proposed cuts would probably force us to reconsider leaving Bergen. For families like ours who have built our lives here, ISB represents one the most important reasons to stay in this city. The Bergen community has benefited a lot from ISB. The city has become more attractive for international professionals, who see the value of quality education in English. Many of the families decided to stay in Bergen, knowing that their children can continue their education at ISB, thus adding their valuable work and experience to the community. ISB is a reason in itself to choose Bergen among other places in Norway, or maybe even Europe. ISB promotes Bergen. I urge you to maintain the current support for this vital institution.

As a parent of a boy in 9th grade at ISB, I am deeply concerned about the severe impact these cuts would have on our community. The proposed reduction would clearly affect the school's ability to maintain its high educational standards. This will lead to significant tuition fee increases for the families who are already making substantial financial commitments for their children's education. Our family moved to Bergen in 2019. Important role in the final decision for moving to Norway and Bergen was the ability for our children to attend International school and continue with the education they had in their home country. It is easier for children to be accepted in a new community in an environment made up of children who have already gone through the same process. We, the parents, both work for Helse Bergen as medical doctors specialists (overleger), radiologist and neurosurgeon. The school provides not only education but plays a significant role in our life. It supported us especially in the beginning in the difficult months of adjustment after moving to Bergen. Proposed funding cuts would surely harm Bergen's reputation. It is impossible to think of it as an attractive destination for international expertise and future investment if no school such as ISB is there. This could have far-reaching consequences for our city's international business community and future growth. I deeply hope Bergen kommune is going to reconsider these budget cuts and maintain support for our school. ISB is more than just a school - it is an important part of Bergen's multicultural community and plays an essential key role in maintaining our city's position as a globally competitive business hub.

As a parent of children at ISB, I am deeply worried about the severe impact these cuts would have on our community. The proposed reduction would fundamentally affect the school's ability to maintain its high educational standards. This would inevitably lead to significant tuition fee increases for families already making substantial financial commitments for their children's education. In my case, 2 children are studying at ISB and it definitely will cause big burden to my family. My family's connection to Bergen is directly tied to the availability of international education. I work for Sotra Link Construction JV as a procurement manager, and like many of my international colleagues, the presence of ISB was crucial in our decision to stay in Bergen. The school provides education and a vital sense of community and stability for international families like ours. These cuts would harm Bergen's reputation as an attractive destination for international expertise and investment. Bergen risks losing its competitive edge in attracting and retaining global talent. This could have far-reaching consequences for our city's international business community and future growth. I strongly urge the Bergen kommune to reconsider these cuts and maintain support for this crucial educational institution. ISB is more than a school\u2014it is an essential part of Bergen's international infrastructure and plays a key role in maintaining our city's position as a globally competitive business hub.

As an IT-specialist working in Bergen's tourism sector, I see firsthand how international education affects our city's business environment. As our project primarily focuses on providing both local and international visitors with educational material centred around the Norwegian culture, I see this change as detrimental. It will inevitably deny others the opportunity to learn and integrate into the Norwegian society better. Moreover, having experience in tourism make us see the direct contributions of the international talent to the local economy. The proposed cuts would deny many people the opportunity to share their perspectives and experiences. If we only concern ourselves with conformity, we not only will be harming the international talents but the Norwegian population itself, seeing as diversity is a key aspect of education. Otherwise, it is no more than a monopoly on knowledge. At SeaTroll AS, we believe in upholding those standards and welcome people of various backgrounds to contribute to our cause and ensure that the material we share appeals to everyone. I urge you to consider the broader implications of these cuts for Bergen's international competitiveness.

As a Subsurface Project Leader (strong background in Earth Sciences and involved in discovery and increased oil recovery of oil/gas fields & critical technology development) working in Bergen's energy sector, I see firsthand how international education affects our city's business environment and social life. Bergen has flourished more in terms of diversity and inclusiveness which has not only impacted social life positively but also helped in shaping niche corners of business - oil/gas, renewable energy and hi-tech industry are some of the examples. The proposed cuts would negatively impact the key businesses which shape Norway due to lack of retention of high quality international resources and in turn dampen the diversity and inclusiveness. At Equinor ASA, we are exposed to relocation in other business frontiers around the world and hence, it becomes extremely challenging for the children to be able to relocate into another curriculum in spite of the other challenges. An international curriculum for children is necessary for the majority of people in this sector of business so that mobility in the interest of the business can be less painful. We truly need to reflect on the increase in mobility in businesses of today. ISB plays a crucial role in the life of people particularly centered around Sandsli which has a big concentration of relevant businesses and its resident employees. Many of the families have relocated to Sandsli so that the children are close to the school. The egalitarian society of Norway is based on broad humane values. This doesn't leave the people like us to bear the eventual hike in fees due to reduction in support by the Bergen Kommune. I urge you to consider the broader implications of these cuts for Bergen's international competitiveness, value of diversity and inclusiveness in social life of locals like us.

Bergen city is known for its multiculturalism, and ISB plays a considerable role in supporting this aspect of the city. Our family has been part of the ISB community for four years, and we chose ISB because of international curriculum and multicultural environment. ISB actively participates in several cultural, local, national and international events, making the ISB community truly integrated to Bergen\u2019s community. For example, we celebrate Diwali and Chinese New Year, we participate in the 17th of May parade and to the Pepperkakebyen, we take part in several actions for the UN day. ISB serves as a bridge between international families and the city, welcoming new families are helping them connect with Bergen through school activities. The proposed cuts would significantly impact families like ours who have committed to international education in Bergen. Beyond the immediate financial burden of increased fees, these changes would greatly affect interactions between ISB and Bergen\u2019s community. ISB has always been an open and inclusive school, providing students with access to diverse activities, such as visits to local leisure parcs (Rush trampoline parc, for example), educational excursions (akvariet, Vilvite, various museums), visits to elderly care facilities, and many more. We fear that this drastic budget cuts will severely limit these interactions, isolating ISB from the local community, reducing the quality of education and turning the school into a less inclusive environment. This would not only harm ISB\u2019s reputation, but could also damage the city\u2019s reputation, potentially making it less attractive for both local and international professionals and their families. We urge you to reconsider these cuts and their impact on families who depend on ISB. https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/?ik=9ad17f1290&view=pt&search=all&permthid=thread-f:1815006746025533200&simpl=msg-f:1815006746025533200 1/2 11/12/24, 1:08 PM International School of Bergen Mail - ISB budget cut feedback Kind regards, Laurence Hoareau https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/?ik=9ad17f1290&view=pt&search=all&permthid=thread-f:1815006746025533200&simpl=msg-f:1815006746025533200 2/2 11/12/24, 1:10 PM International School of Bergen Mail - ISB budget cut feedback Parent Support <parentsupport@isbergen.no> ISB budget cut feedback 1 message Steckmest Elisabeth <elst@kt.no> 6 November 2024 at 13:05 To: \"parentsupport@isbergen.no\" <parentsupport@isbergen.no> Dear Utvalg for finans, kultur og n\u00e6ring, & Utvalg for barnehage, skole og idrett We are writing to express our concern about the proposed funding cuts to the International School of Bergen (ISB).

Our family relocated to Bergen from Qatar in 2024, drawn by the unique opportunity for our children to continue their International Baccalaureate (IB) education in an internationally focused environment. Since starting at ISB, our children have quickly found a sense of belonging within the school community, despite the short time they have been here. This integration is a direct result of ISB\u2019s exceptional quality and welcoming environment, both of which would be challenged by the proposed cuts. ISB\u2019s role goes far beyond academics; it enables children from diverse backgrounds to settle smoothly and positively into Bergen and embrace it as their new home. As professionals\u2014one of us an Oil and Gas expert at SLB and the other an application scientist for Electron Microscopy with Thermo Fisher Scientific\u2014the supportive, multicultural environment at ISB was a key factor in our decision to move to Bergen. The ability to secure a high-quality, internationally recognized education for our children is essential to attracting skilled talent to the region. Reducing funding to ISB would burden families with potentially prohibitive tuition increases, limiting ISB\u2019s accessibility and compromising the very quality that enables children like ours to integrate so well. This school is more than an educational institution; it is an investment in Bergen\u2019s reputation and future. ISB students develop a strong connection to Bergen, fostering a sense of belonging to the city even if their families eventually move elsewhere. These students go on to become ambassadors of Bergen and represent its values of diversity, collaboration, and inclusion, carrying a lifelong bond to the city and a willingness to advocate for it globally. We strongly urge Bergen Kommune to reconsider the proposed funding cuts and to continue supporting ISB. The school\u2019s contributions to Bergen\u2019s multicultural community make it an invaluable asset, enriching both the social and economic fabric of our city.

As a Bergen resident who attended ISB myself and, more recently, as a parent of children who have been enrolled there for the past six years, I know firsthand the essential role ISB plays in both the lives of local families and the broader community. ISB provides an inclusive, internationally-minded learning environment that has shaped students in Bergen for decades. This unique school not only enriches students\u2019 lives but also makes Bergen an attractive city for families and professionals from around the world. For global talent considering relocating to Bergen, ISB is a significant factor, and its presence directly benefits our city by fostering an open, diverse, and dynamic community. As academics affiliated with the University of Bergen and Haukeland University Hospital, my family and I understand that an international school is vital for attracting world-class researchers and professionals to our city. ISB\u2019s current funding model supports this role and preserves Bergen\u2019s reputation as a global center for research and innovation. For these reasons, I urge you to reconsider the proposed funding cuts to ISB. The school\u2019s unique contributions to Bergen are invaluable, supporting not only individual families but also our city\u2019s growth and success as a truly international hub. Thank you for considering the impact of this decision on the diverse families who call Bergen home. With warm regards, and family Vinita Rangroo Thrane MD PhD Consultant paediatric ophthalmologist Haukeland University Hospital Bergen, Norway Dear Utvalg for finans, kultur og n\u00e6ring, & Utvalg for barnehage, skole og idrett, I am writing to express my highest concerns about the proposed funding cuts to the International School of Bergen (ISB) outlined in Bergen Kommune's budget proposal for 2025-2028. As a parent of a girl in 8th and a boy in 10th grades at ISB, I am deeply concerned about the severe impact these cuts would have on our community. The proposed reduction would fundamentally a ect the school's ability to maintain its high educational standards. This will lead to significant tuition fee increases for the families who are already making substantial financial commitments for their children's education. Our family moved to Bergen in September 2023. Important role in the final decision for moving to Norway and Bergen was the ability for our children to attend international school and continue with the education they had in their home country. It is easier for children to be accepted in a new community in an environment made up of children who have already gone through the same process. We, the parents, both work for the salmon industry as highly skilled professionals in managing positions based in our previous working experience. The school provides not only education but plays a significant role in our life. It supported us especially in the di icult months in adjustment after moving to Bergen. These cuts would surely harm Bergen's reputation as an attractive destination for international expertise and investment. Bergen risks losing its competitive edge in attracting and retaining global talent. This could have far-reaching consequences for our city's international business community and future growth. I strongly urge the Bergen kommune to reconsider these cuts and maintain support for our school. ISB is more than a school\u2014it is an important part of Bergen's multicultural community and plays an essential key role in maintaining our city's position as a globally competitive business hub.

As Bergen residents and parents of two children at ISB\u2014one in Grade 2 and one in Kindergarten\u2014we want to share our perspective on why the school's current funding model should be maintained. As professionals working in the higher education, technology, and healthcare sectors, we made a conscious choice to enroll our children at ISB because we strongly believe in the value of international education. Our decision was based on ISB\u2019s proven ability to nurture global competence and cultural understanding, as well as maintain future mobility opportunities for our family. The proposed cuts would signi cantly impact the accessibility and quality of fi international education in Bergen. These changes would a ect not only our ff family but also the broader community's access to educational diversity. The likely signi cant increase in tuition fees would make international education fi accessible only to privileged families while potentially compromising ISB\u2019s excellent programs and international accreditation. This would weaken Bergen\u2019s ability to attract and retain global talent across crucial sectors, including healthcare, education, research, and industry. ISB is more than just a school\u2013it is a vital institution contributing to Bergen's character as an open, diverse, and forward-looking city. The school creates an environment where local and international perspectives meet and enrich each other, providing all our children with experiences and understanding that will be invaluable in their future. We strongly urge you to maintain the current funding model for ISB, considering its crucial role in supporting educational diversity and opportunities for Bergen's families. Bergen, 10.11.2024 Kristine Selvikv\u00e5g Lundervold Alexander Selvikv\u00e5g Lundervold Dear Utvalg for finans, kultur og n\u00e6ring, & Utvalg for barnehage, skole og idrett I am writing regarding the proposed funding cuts to the International School of Bergen (ISB). Having lived in Bergen since 2007 (I am an American native married to a Norwegian woman with 3 \u201chybrid barn.\u201d), I have seen how ISB has contributed to our city's growth as an international hub. Our family has been part of the ISB community since 2023 school year when we enrolled our son, Philip, into 8th grade. We had heard many families speak highly of ISB (both Norwegian families as well as recent immigrants) and we just could not be more pleased with the results in terms of how our son has developed. And we now intend to enroll our 9 year old daughter, Annabelle, into 5th grade next year. We see it as the perfect marriage to begin at Kirkevoll Skole, develop our children\u2019s early years there, and then \u201cgraduate\u201d to ISB for another stage of development. Then our children have deep roots here in Fana and stay connected through sports and arts, but then they also have the benefits of what ISB brings to bear as well. The proposed cuts I have found deeply disturbing. For families like ours who have built our lives here, ISB represents a reason in fact to stay in Bergen rather than moving away. I work in Private Equity and I have in fact nearly convinced a partner to move to Bergen - from Palo Alto - where the visit to ISB played a pivotal role in moving he, his wife and his daughter to say \u201cwhy not.\u201d Without ISB being vital and alive and blossoming, this type of conversation is simply impossible. It speaks to Bergen being indeed international rather than provincial. I was recently one of the headline speakers at the opening ceremony for Innvasjonsuke where the main theme was \u201chow to attract international capital to Bergen.\u201d How on earth can we set our sights on such a goal without supporting our international institutions? I urge you to maintain the current support for this amazing school. It is a vital and critical element to the future evolution of Bergen. Kind regards, 05/11/24 Kelly Moulton Head of Capital Formation WAVE Equity Partners Fanahammeren 32B 5244 Fana (Boston HQ) November 10, 2024 Attn: Utvalg for finans, kultur og n\u00e6ring, & Utvalg for barnehage, skole og idrett Bergen Kommune Norway SUBJECT: Concern about the proposed funding cuts to the International School of Bergen (ISB) Dear all, I am writing to express my serious concern about the proposed funding cuts to the International School of Bergen (ISB) outlined in Bergen Kommune's budget proposal for 2025-2028. We are a Portuguese family with two children (one year old and 6 years old), both students at ISB. As a parent, I am deeply worried about the severe impact these cuts would have on our family, and on many other international families like ours. The proposed reduction would inevitably lead to significant tuition fee increases for families already making substantial financial commitments for our children's education. In addition, it would affect the school's ability to maintain its high educational standards. Our family's connection with Bergen is directly tied to the availability of an international school. My husband works for Sotra Link Construction, as Environmental Manager, and like many of his international colleagues, the presence of ISB was crucial in our decision to move and stay in Bergen. To note that, by working in construction international projects, we must rely on international schools to assure a continuous and stable education for our kids. So, the ISB provides the necessary education and a vital sense of community and stability for international families like ours. I can honestly share with you, that before moving to Norway, we were having serious doubts if this would be the right decision for our family, particularly considering our oldest special son, diagnosed with a disorder that makes his adaptation to school really challenging. Even knowing our son difficulties, the ISB has warmly welcomed him, with all the support of professional and kind teachers, assistants and staff, so that we could see our son adapting, growing and learning in an environment where he feels safe and comfortable. This made us so happy and proud of our decision of moving to Bergen and of choosing ISB school for our son. Kindly, note that these cuts, and their consequent tuition fees increase, will definitely impact our ability to afford these fees, harming our children education and our chance to stay in Bergen. Like my family, many other international families will be impacted. So, consequently, these cuts would also harm Bergen's reputation, as an attractive destination for international expertise and investment. We strongly urge the Kommune to reconsider these cuts and their impact on so many families who depend on ISB, by maintaining support for this crucial educational institution. Please, note that ISB is more than a school\u2014it is an essential part of our family and for sure for all Bergen's international infrastructure, playing a key role in overall Bergen international competitiveness. Thank you and looking forward to your reconsideration. Kind Regards, Luisa Gabriela Duro dos Santos Dear Utvalg for finans, kultur og n\u00e6ring & Utvalg for barnehage, skole og idrett, We are writing regarding the proposed funding cuts to the International School of Bergen (ISB). As parents of two children currently in grades 1 and 6 at ISB, we feel compelled to share our concerns about the potential impact these cuts would have on the school\u2019s students, teachers, staff, and the entire community. We began our connection with ISB in 2017 when our daughter joined the Preschool 4 class, and she has been a student at ISB ever since. Our son spent nearly two years in a local kindergarten before moving to ISB, where he remains their student to this day. After so many years being with ISB, what has impressed us the most is not only their high educational standards but also the school\u2019s continuous growth. Although many used to think that ISB was primarily for expatriates and their children, it has become a school where students experience a unique balance: an internationally competitive educational system combined with a comprehensive program that encourages them to express their emotions, explore their identities, and connect with the local community. We have always been proud to be part of ISB\u2019s history and to witness its development as an integral part of the city Bergen. The presence of ISB is important not only for attracting families seeking a temporary educational solution for their children while working short-term in Bergen, but also for providing a study option for local families that emphasizes global citizenship. We have seen many families like ours, who, after securing a permanent job and deciding to settle in Bergen, choose to keep their happy children at ISB. There are also local families who transferred their children from local schools to ISB. There is no doubt that ISB is growing and expanding. ISB students now have increasing opportunities to participate in regional and national activities and competitions. All of that was made possible by the generous support of Bergen Kommune. Importantly, the school has yet to reach its full potential. We would really like to see more talented ISB students shine in regional and national competitions, and to see them go on to contribute to the diversity and cultural richness of this beautiful city. As a permanent faculty member who has taught many courses at all levels at NHH Norwegian School of Economics, I have observed the tremendous impact that a diverse student and staff body has on both the learning environment and teaching quality. Again, ISB should not be limited themselves as a temporary place for expatriates; it should be a home for any student and family who value an intercultural study environment and seek a deeper understanding of the world. The proposed reduction in support for ISB would seriously hinder these developments, likely forcing ISB to significantly increase their fees to maintain the quality of its educational programs. Such immediate increases in the coming years will push many families, including ours, to the financial limit or even to the point where many students may have to leave ISB unwillingly. 1 We truly believe that a major city like Bergen must have a well-developed international school to attract people from diverse countries and backgrounds. Furthermore, from a long-term perspective, the development of an international school challenges the local education system, which will encourage development across the board. Hence, rather than cutting support, we urge Bergen Kommune to maintain or even increase its investment in ISB, making it a symbol of diversity and inclusiveness for Norway\u2019s second largest city. Kind regards, Bergen 8th November 2024, Nhat Quang Le Dung Nguyen Thuy Tran Father of two ISB students Mother of two ISB students Associate Professor in Marketing Sustainability and Systems Accountant NHH Norwegian School of Economics World Kinect Energy Services 2 Dear Utvalg for finans, kultur og n\u00e6ring, & Utvalg for barnehage, skole og idrett My name is Ozan Mert G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk, and I am a researcher at NORCE Norwegian Research Centre AS. I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the planned budget cut for the International School of Bergen (ISB). Our son, Aziz, is a current student at ISB, where he returned this year after two years in a Norwegian school. The school\u2019s quality of education, internationally inclusive curriculum, and dedicated staff have provided him with a robust foundation for his personal and academic development. The accessibility and affordability of ISB were primary reasons for my family\u2019s decision to relocate to Bergen. As a researcher, I value an educational environment that promotes global perspectives and academic excellence, both of which are vital not only to my family\u2019s needs but also to the larger community of international professionals in Bergen. ISB\u2019s presence makes Bergen uniquely attractive to researchers and professionals from all over the world, bringing diverse expertise and enhancing Bergen\u2019s status as a global, knowledge-based city. This planned budget cut would cause a substantial increase in tuition fees, which would likely force our family to withdraw Aziz from ISB, as we would no longer be able to afford the cost. Without ISB, we and many other families would face significant challenges adjusting to local educational options, likely requiring relocation or considerable adjustments. I sincerely urge you to reconsider the proposed budget cut and maintain ISB\u2019s funding. Preserving the affordability and accessibility of this school is not only a benefit for students like Aziz but a meaningful investment in the future of Bergen as a globally appealing destination for high-caliber talent. Thank you very much in advance for considering this matter. Warm regards, Ozan Mert G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk Bergen, 10.11.2024 Bergen, November 7, 2024 Dear Utvalg for finans, kultur og n\u00e6ring, & Utvalg for barnehage, skole og idrett, Bergen kommune We are writing regarding the proposed funding cuts to the International School of Bergen (ISB). Having lived in Bergen for several years, we have seen how ISB has contributed to our city's growth as an international hub. Our family has been part of the ISB community for 13 years, and our family chose ISB because of international curriculum and multicultural environment. The proposed cuts would significantly impact families like ours who have committed to international education in Bergen. As academics at the University of Bergen and Haukeland University Hospital, we can add that an international school is essential for attracting top researchers globally. This is significant for Bergen as an international city and as an educational and research center We urge you to reconsider these cuts and their impact on both local and international families who depend on ISB. Kind regards, Anne E Christensen Mellgren (sign.) Gunnar Mellgren Cristiane Hamnes Parent of Boy Grade 9 November 11, 2024 Dear Utvalg for finans, kultur og n\u00e6ring, & Utvalg for barnehage, skole og idrett I am writing to express my concern about the proposed funding cuts to the International School of Bergen (ISB). As a Bergen resident and parent of ISB children, I want to share my perspective on why the school's current funding model should be maintained. Our family chose ISB because of the international curriculum, multicultural environment, and specific educational needs. The proposed cuts would significantly impact families like ours who have committed to international education in Bergen. Beyond the immediate financial burden of increased fees, these changes would affect we[ impact on your family] ISB contributes to Bergen's diversity and international character, which benefits all residents. I urge you to reconsider these cuts and their impact on both local and international families who depend on ISB. Kindest regards, Cristiane Hamnes Mob.: 980 68 262 To the Committee for Finance, Culture, and Business & the Committee for Kindergarten, School, and Sports Dear Members of the Committee, I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the proposed funding cuts to the International School of Bergen (ISB). As a Bergen resident and a parent of three ISB students, I want to share my perspective on the importance of maintaining the current funding model for the school. Our family chose ISB for its international curriculum, multicultural environment, and the opportunities it provides for international mobility. This flexibility was especially valuable when we had to move abroad temporarily a few years ago. The proposed funding cuts would have significant impacts on families like ours who are committed to international education in Bergen. Beyond the immediate financial strain from increased fees, these changes could affect the stability of the entire ISB community. Higher fees may force some students to leave, and there is a real risk of staff reductions, which could jeopardize the quality of education. A decline in the school\u2019s standards would also harm Bergen\u2019s appeal as an international hub, potentially affecting academia, research, and business development in our city. ISB is highly regarded by both international and local families as a stable, inclusive environment that provides continuity in education standards, supporting children\u2019s social and emotional well-being. The school offers a unique option for international mobility, benefiting not only international families but also local families who may need this flexibility. Over our 13 years at ISB, we have observed that the school\u2019s diversity greatly benefits both local and international students. Growing up alongside peers from diverse backgrounds fosters open-mindedness, inclusivity, and a global mindset. This environment encourages respect for differences and cultivates the ability to work collaboratively on shared goals. Such qualities are invaluable, and they contribute to Bergen\u2019s reputation as a truly global, inclusive, and innovative city. The support from Bergen Municipality for ISB acknowledges the invaluable role the school plays in fostering Bergen\u2019s development as an international and sustainable city. For nearly 50 years, ISB has contributed significantly to making Bergen a competitive and attractive location in the academic and business worlds. ISB\u2019s appeal lies in its balanced mix of local and international students, which enhances integration and contributes to Bergen\u2019s positive image as Norway\u2019s second-largest city, with a focus on international growth, prosperity, and development. In my opinion, ISB is not a competitor to local schools. It is a unique institution that provides essential diversity, flexibility, and predictability, which are necessary for securing the international workforce that Bergen relies on across various sectors. Thank you for considering the concerns of our community. Sincerely, Ekaterina Mohn "
