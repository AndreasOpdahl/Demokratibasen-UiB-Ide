Sea level rise, coupled with rapid urbanization, entails significant environmental, economic, social and cultural impacts to which coastal cities are particularly exposed. Coastal flooding, erosion, inland salinization and other sea level rise impacts have been increasingly affecting our cities and territories. These phenomena are predicted to increase dramatically, amplifying the vulnerability of expanding coastal populations. By 2050, up to a billion people could be living in coastal cities and thus be at risk from rising sea levels. Recalling the main conclusions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): \u25b6 Greenhouse gas emissions that warm the planet cause sea level to rise through expansion of ocean water and melting of ice; \u25b6 Global mean sea level continues to rise at an increasing rate and will further accelerate, reaching up to 1.10 meter in 2100, if greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are not sharply reduced; \u25b6 Extreme sea level events, while historically rare (once per century in the recent past), are projected to occur more frequently (up to once per year) in many locations over the 21st century, especially in tropical regions; \u25b6 Many low-lying coastal cities and small islands will be exposed to risks of flooding and land loss annually by 2050; \u00c9tats insulaires seront annuellement expos\u00e9s \u00e0 des risques d\u2019inondation et de perte de terres d\u2019ici 2050 ; \u25b6 Delays in mitigation and adaptation will substantially lower their cost-effectiveness. While cities are at the forefront of increasing climate disasters, they are also the first responders to climate-induced changes. As hubs of innovation and creativity, many cities around the globe have started to implement diverse mitigation and adaptation measures at local levels. We strive to achieve the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \u2013 in particular SDG 11 \u201cto make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable\u201d. While urbanization threatens wealth and resources in coastal areas, cities need to strengthen the resilience of coastal ecosystems, including by implementing ecosystem-based adaptation. 1 Yet, our commitment is not enough. We need the international community to rally behind cities threatened by sea level rise to collectively scale-up action to strengthen coastal resilience. At the local level, we need improved coordination with national coastal policies. Therefore, we \u2013 Mayors and Governors of the world\u2019s coastal cities \u2013 call all relevant stakeholders, building on the \u00abCities Race to Resilience\u00bb campaign, to scale-up mitigation and adaptation action to limit the impacts of sea level rise on cities, communities and their territories. Following UNFCCC COP 26 in Glasgow, current global policies set us on an alarming path towards a warming of about 2.7\u00b0C. Therefore, We urge all States to: \u25b6 Drastically reduce GHG emissions to deliver on the 1.5\u00b0C target of the Paris Agreement, thus limiting sea level rise-induced risks; \u25b6 Recognize sea level rise as a significant threat to be urgently addressed in the international agenda, especially within the processes of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change; \u25b6 Support and commit resources to risk assessments and the implementation of scientifically-informed, equitable and just adaptation plans to sea level rise impacts. Sea level rise cannot be tackled through a one-size-fits-all response, and requires considering a variety of factors, specific to each city. Four priority areas need to be leveraged to successfully adapt coastal cities to sea level rise. Accordingly, we call for: 1/ Mobilizing science and observation systems to guide adaptation to sea level rise. In a context of great uncertainty, it is paramount to improve and expand 3/ Fostering adaptive and hybrid solutions in the face of sea level rise. Facing the complexity of implementing tailored responses, it is crucial to combine different types data collection, observation and climate projections at of responses (e.g. protection, accommodation, Nature- local levels, while drawing on multiple knowledge systems, based Solutions and managed retreat) and to coordinate including local and indigenous, to feed systemic models responses at all levels of governance and across all sectors. and inform decisions. Experience-sharing on adaptation plans among coastal cities is crucial to accelerate progress, increase response 2/ Integrating societal issues within adaptation plans to sea level rise. Locally, social vulnerability, justice efficiency and avoid maladaptation. and equity need to be addressed within all adaptation plans to sea level rise to break down local priorities as well as the numerous risks and barriers faced by marginalized 4/ Boosting public funding and private investments for adaptation to sea level rise. A broader set of financial actors, tools and incentives need to be engaged to communities. Nationally, governments have a shared increase and align resources for climate-smart investments. responsibility to ensure solidarity between coastal and land- Risk vulnerability assessments should be supported to locked areas. At the multilateral level, the many disparities leverage the capacity of innovation and investment by the (e.g., finance, technology, capacity) between developed private and public sector, and mainstream climate adaptation and developing countries must be reduced, thus ensuring insurance and solidarity mechanisms. climate justice. We invite Mayors and Governors of the world\u2019s coastal cities aiming to tackle sea level rise to sign this declaration and thus commit, in collaboration with their governments, to monitoring progress towards the development and implementation of effective, sustainable and equitable mitigation and adaptation strategies. 2 "
